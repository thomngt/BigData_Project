Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Comfortable and great quality for price!!",28/02/2024,"They are very durable, I've had them about a month and are very easy to clean, comfortable and good deal for quality shoes"

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Comfortable and great quality for price!!",28/02/2024,"They are very durable, I've had them about a month and are very easy to clean, comfortable and good deal for quality shoes"

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Comfortable and great quality for price!!",28/02/2024,"They are very durable, I've had them about a month and are very easy to clean, comfortable and good deal for quality shoes"

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip.

Comfortable and great quality for price!!",28/02/2024,"They are very durable, I've had them about a month and are very easy to clean, comfortable and good deal for quality shoes"

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Not so slip resistant",10/10/2023,"Heavy and bulky feeling, but the foot bed is nice and supportive.I have not had a problem with Sketchers in the past, but less than 2 months after purchasing these, and only wearing them a few times, I had a slip and fall accident (on 9/23/2023) on a barley wet floor. Falling hard, and hurting my right shoulder and lower back/hip. I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."

I couldn't reach forward or raise my arm above my head and could hardly stand without excruciating pain for several days, including needing to head to ER after my shift the following day, because I couldn't do the pain anymore.I had to file a worker's Comp claim and do two weeks of physical therapy before they would release me. My restaurant made me buy from Shoes For Crews, and they come with a great return policy (90 days as we have a corp. account) and if I fall, wearing their shoes, they cover it.I will not be buying sketchers for work again."

too narrow at the heel",13/02/2024,It was really too narrow at the heel. I used to buy a lot of Skechers because the sole are so comfortable but this shape is not right for my feet. Immediately not comfortable.

They are Skechers so of course they are great!",24/01/2024,They are very comfortable.  Support my very high arch perfectly.  My feet stay dry.  We have a very slippery floor at work and I have slipped once since getting these shoes.  They aren't very pretty but that's not what I bought them for.  Everything else about them is great.

Quality shoe",04/03/2024,"Nonslip is great. And a fairly comfortable shoe for my 9+ hours on my feet.  Only a four star because it isn’t my favorite which is the sketchers softie, which hasn’t been available on Amazon in my Amazonian foot size anymore"

Very roomy and comfortable shoes that are priced right!",05/02/2024,"I like that these have extra room in the toes and my feet are not cramped. Also, the material that they are made with is flexible and doesn’t rub hard against my feet. They are somewhat chunky and offer extra support to posture with their block heals. Overall I’m satisfied and the quality is there. First day wearing them they got a little slippery but nothing too major. It was in a bad spot in the kitchen where everyone tends to slip. I think with a little breaking in and wear this will be less noticeable. I really think they were priced right, as I got them for less than forty. I would definitely buy them again if when these wear out. I did buy some upgraded Orthotics Insoles because the memory foam insoles that come with do wear down quickly. That’s been my experience anyway. With the upgrades I would put this shoe up against the higher dollar work shoes that cost over a bill. Keep your money in your wallet and give these a try. Your feet, legs, back and wallet will thank you for it."

Exactly as described",27/02/2024,"Great shoes, do exactly what they're supposed to. Perfect for a restaurant environment, and overall a bit higher quality than I was expecting. The only minor flaw I noticed is the sizing. Fit true to size /except/ there's a decent amount of space between my heel and the back of the shoe, leading to some lift. I definitely find it noticeable, but can still work a shift without issue. Other than that, the stitching and make of the shoe is pretty decent for the price."
